### Problem 1: Manager Performance Analysis

1. **Total Sales by Manager:**
   - Calculate the total sales amount (`Sale_amt`) managed by each `Manager`.
   - Visualize the total sales for each manager using a bar chart.

2. **Transaction Count by Manager:**
   - Find out how many sales transactions each manager handled.
   - Visualize the number of transactions for each manager with a pie chart.

3. **Average Sale Amount by Manager:**
   - Calculate the average sales amount per transaction for each manager.
   - Visualize the average sales amount per manager using a line plot.

4. **Salesman Contribution Analysis:**
   - For each manager, determine which `SalesMan` contributed the most to the total sales.
   - Visualize the contribution of each salesman using a stacked bar chart for each manager.

5. **Region-wise Sales Analysis:**
   - Calculate the total sales amount by `Region` and visualize it using a horizontal bar chart.


## Dataset

Ensure that you have a dataset containing at least the following columns:
- `Item`: Name or identifier of the product.
- `Sale_amt`: Sales amount of the product.
- `OrderDate`: Date when the order was placed.
- `Unit_price`: Price per unit of the product.
- `Units`: Number of units sold.
- `Region`: Region where the sale took place (if applicable).

## Instructions

- Use Python and relevant libraries such as `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn` to perform data analysis and visualization.
- Ensure that all visualizations are clear, well-labeled, and properly formatted.
- Provide code and explanations in a Jupyter notebook or Python script.
